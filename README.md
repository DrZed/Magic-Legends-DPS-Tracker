# Magic-Legends-DPS-Tracker
## Requires Java 8 might work with higher versions, no guarantee 

* Line Graph does nothing atm planed DPS over time
* Saves combat log in pieces via (Encounters) which are calculated seperated fights
* Planned to load them in the future to review if you want
* May be resource intensive, optimization comes later

1. Download
2. Edit Config (change Keldon Warlord to your character name and change directory to your game's log folder)
3. use command `/combatlog 1` ingame to enable logging combat to logs folder
4. launch program after first hit of something to load latest file
5. Enjoy the live tracking
